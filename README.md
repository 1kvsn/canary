## What it does

Canary is a privacy-focused app that lets users discover personalized public content without needing an account. The user can browse the home feed based on their preferences, search for specific topics, stay up to date with their favorite users, and archive tweets into multiple groups for the future. 

Users can discover trending topics all around the world by choosing any country from a list of countries. 
The user can also opt to browse the most popular or most recent tweets on the topics or user accounts from the search results.

To make the app's content more relevant, we have reverse engineered and implemented Twitter's Lists feature. In addition, we have improved Twitter's Bookmarks feature by enabling users to create multiple archives with custom names that will store tweets. So, while browsing through the Canary app, the user can add any of their favorite tweets to any archive. 

Users can view media like GIFs, images and videos right in the applications and also share tweets among their social circles. Moreover, we offer a choice that redirects the user to Twitter in order to allow them to interact with tweets.
